# Behav-Marker: A Novel Artificial Intelligence based Detection Marker for Prodromal Parkinson's Disease Screening
This is the code implementation of the method used in our paper *"Behav-Marker: A Novel Artificial Intelligence based Detection Marker for Prodromal Parkinson's Disease Screening"*
# Datasets
The third-party datasets used in our study are provided under the Creative Commons Public License: Movebank (https://www.movebank.org/), Microsoft T-Drive Project (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/t-drive-trajectory-data-sample/), Geolife Trajectories 1.3 (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52367), Taxi GPS Dataset (https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/94216), and Gowalla Dataset (https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html).

We make our internal data public. The internal data (trajectory maps and heat maps) used in this study are now open to the research community through an open platform (), which can be used by academic research peers to verify experimental results, promote method replication, and promote collaborative exploration in the field of early screening for Parkinson's disease.
# Software
To achieve automated behavioral screening analysis for the prodromal phase of PD, we developed an interactive software tool that integrates the PD screening model. By simply uploading two types of data, trajectory plots and heatmaps, the tool provides a quantitative assessment of PD risk.
