# Open-Source Parkinson's Disease Screening Tool (v1.0.0)
In order to automate the screening and analysis of prodromal behaviors of Parkinson's disease, we have developed an interactive software tool (applicable to Windows 10 and above) that integrates the Parkinson's disease screening model. By simply uploading two types of data, trajectory map and heat map, the risk of Parkinson's disease can be quantitatively assessed. The interactive software is now open to the scientific research community through an open platform (), and can be used by academic and scientific research peers to verify the experimental results.


# Models
We also make public the best model parameters optimized on the internal dataset used in this study (.pth format), which can be obtained through the open platform ().
